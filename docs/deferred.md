## 1. Roadmap items (scope-deferred by design)

Not bugs; intentional deferral in the design phase. ✅ = retired (landed in a prior or current milestone).

**v0.4 scope (final):** close every real bug and parity gap on SVS and NDPI that we have a fixture to drive. Landed: L12 (NDPI edge-tile OOB fill), L17 (NDPI label cropH), L6 / R13 (NDPI Map pages). Permanent items (L4, L5, L14) stay documented as design choices.

**v0.6+ scope (revised on 2026-04-26 after the v0.5 ship):** OME TIFF
in v0.6 closes the last upstream-opentile format. After that we venture
beyond upstream's coverage starting with **Ventana BIF** in v0.7 — a
clinically-common Roche / Ventana iScan format that openslide reads but
upstream opentile doesn't. **Leica SCN** and **Generic Tiled TIFF** are
tentative v0.8+ candidates, gated on real-slide demand. **3DHistech
TIFF** (R6) and **Sakura SVSlide** (R15) are parked behind GH issues —
3DHistech is a niche MRXS conversion target we've never encountered in
the wild; Sakura is rare enough to follow the same trigger-driven
deferral as R4/R9.

The methodology shift starting in v0.7: opentile-go leaves the
"port-from-upstream-opentile-byte-for-byte" pattern. Openslide is the
practical reference for BIF / SCN / Generic TIFF, but it's LGPL 2.1, so
we read it for understanding rather than direct port; correctness bar
shifts from byte-parity to pixel-equivalence with openslide on decoded
tiles.

R4 / R9 (SVS corrupt-edge reconstruct + JP2K decode/encode) remain
parked at [#1](https://github.com/cornish/opentile-go/issues/1) until a
real slide motivates the work.

| ID | Feature | Target | Status |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| R1 | NDPI format support (Hamamatsu) | v0.2 | ✅ landed (Batches 2-7, parity verified) |
| R2 | `internal/jpeg` marker package | v0.2 | ✅ landed (Batch 2) |
| R3 | SVS associated images — label, overview, thumbnail | v0.2 (promoted from v0.3) | ✅ landed (Task 21, `9cd27cb`) |
| R4 | Aperio SVS corrupt-edge reconstruct fix (currently returns `ErrCorruptTile`) | v0.5+ | deferred — see [#1](https://github.com/cornish/opentile-go/issues/1). Originally promoted to v0.4; demoted on 2026-04-26 because none of our local SVS slides exhibit corrupt edges and 12 tasks of cgo + Pillow-port work to deliver a synthetic-fixture-only feature isn't completeness, it's speculation. Issue captures the full upstream algorithm + Go-side dependency tree; trigger to take it on is a real slide that fails on us with `ErrCorruptTile`. |
| R5 | Philips TIFF (sparse-tile filler) | v0.5 | ✅ landed (commits `1ad463c..7e7bde0`, parity verified across 4 fixtures) |
| R6 | 3DHistech TIFF | parked | parked behind GH issue (TBD). MRXS conversion target produced by 3DHistech software; rare in practice. Trigger to take it on is a real slide. Upstream opentile has a ~200 LOC reader; cheap to revive if motivated. |
| R7 | OME TIFF | v0.6 | ✅ landed. Closes the upstream-opentile format set; SubIFD-based pyramid + multi-image deviation + dual-reference parity (opentile-py + tifffile). |
| R8 | BigTIFF support | v0.2 | ✅ landed (Batch 1) |
| R9 | JPEG 2000 decode/encode (currently passes through native tiles; decode matters for associated-image re-encoding and corrupt-tile reconstruct) | v0.5+ | deferred — see [#1](https://github.com/cornish/opentile-go/issues/1). Only consumer is R4; deferred together. Native JP2K tile passthrough (the v0.1+ behaviour) continues to work — decode is only needed for the reconstruct chain. |
| R10 | Remote I/O backends (S3, HTTP range, fsspec equivalents) | out-of-scope; consumers supply `io.ReaderAt` | permanent |
| R11 | Python parity oracle under `//go:build parity` | v0.2 | ✅ landed (Task 25-26, Batch 7) |
| R12 | CLI wrapper | out-of-scope for v1 | permanent |
| R13 | NDPI Map (`mag == -2.0`) pages exposed as associated images | v0.4 | ✅ landed (commit `7ac3f88`, paired with L6). `Tiler.Associated()` now exposes `Kind() == "map"` entries on slides that carry them. |
| R14 | Ventana BIF (Roche / iScan) | v0.7 | ✅ landed (commit range `b2e7f53..f602b20`). New `formats/bif/` package, new `internal/bifxml/` XML walker, `Level.TileOverlap()` interface evolution, blank-tile generator, ScanWhitePoint-filled empty-tile path, JPEGTables splice for legacy iScan. Two parity oracles: tifffile byte-equality on Ventana-1 (DP 200 path), openslide infrastructure shipped + assertion gated to v0.8 (see L19 below). Sampled-tile fixtures committed for both fixtures via `TestSlideParity`. Correctness bar revised mid-implementation: openslide rejects spec-compliant DP 200 BIFs (`Direction="LEFT"`) and may interpret legacy iScan differently, so byte-stable references are tifffile + our own committed sample-tile SHAs rather than openslide pixel-equivalence. |
| R15 | Sakura SVSlide | parked | parked behind GH issue (TBD). Rare format; openslide reads it. Trigger-driven deferral. |
| R16 | Leica SCN | v0.8 (tentative) | BigTIFF-based; common in research microscopy. Openslide reader as reference. Decide based on real-slide demand. |
| R17 | Generic Tiled TIFF | v0.8+ (tentative) | catch-all fallback for unknown vendors with standard TIFF tile layout. Decide based on real-slide demand and whether end users are hitting `ErrUnsupportedFormat` on standards-compliant slides. |

## 1a. Deviations from upstream Python opentile

Behaviours where opentile-go intentionally differs from upstream
Python opentile 0.20.0. Each entry names the upstream behaviour, our
deviation, and why. This section is the canonical source of truth;
README.md and per-format docs link here.

### NDPI synthesised label (since v0.2)

- **Upstream:** `NdpiTiler.labels` returns empty — Python opentile does
  not surface NDPI labels at all.
- **opentile-go:** synthesises a label by cropping the left 30% of the
  overview page (`formats/ndpi/associated.go::newLabelImage`).
  Disable via `opentile.WithNDPISynthesizedLabel(false)`.
- **Reason:** Aperio-style label affordance is more useful for
  downstream consumers than nothing; opt-out preserves the upstream
  no-label behaviour for callers that need it.
- **Tracking:** L14 in §2 below.

### NDPI Map page surfacing (since v0.4)

- **Upstream:** filters out tifffile's `series.name == 'Map'` pages
  even though tifffile classifies them.
- **opentile-go:** exposes them as `Tiler.Associated()` entries with
  `Kind() == "map"` (single-channel grayscale uncompressed strip
  passthrough).
- **Reason:** the data is in the file and tifffile already classifies
  it; surfacing matches what the underlying TIFF carries. Not opt-out-
  able; slides without a Map page silently produce no map entry.
- **Tracking:** R13 in §1, retired in v0.4 (commit `7ac3f88`).

### Multi-image OME pyramid exposure (since v0.6)

- **Upstream:** in multi-image OME-TIFF files (e.g.
  `Leica-2.ome.tiff` with 4 main pyramids), the base
  `Tiler.__init__` loop silently overwrites `_level_series_index` on
  each match — only the last main pyramid is exposed via the
  legacy single-pyramid API.
- **opentile-go:** exposes all main pyramids via the new
  `Tiler.Images()` API; legacy `Tiler.Levels()` remains as a
  shortcut for `Images()[0].Levels()`. Single-image formats
  (SVS / NDPI / Philips) return a one-element slice.
- **Reason:** encoding upstream's accidental drop in our port would
  bake in an upstream oversight. Not intentional design.
- **Verification:** parity for the dropped Leica-2 main pyramids
  comes via the v0.6 tifffile-based oracle
  (`tests/oracle/tifffile_test.go`); opentile-py oracle covers the
  last-wins-exposed pyramid only.
- **Tracking:** R7 in §1, retired in v0.6.

### OME PlanarConfiguration=2 plane-0-only indexing (since v0.6)

- **Upstream:** silently uses plane 0 only when `PlanarConfiguration=2`
  via flat `y*W + x` indexing into the per-channel-tripled
  TileOffsets / StripOffsets arrays.
- **opentile-go:** mirrors that for byte parity. Other planes are
  inaccessible through our public API.
- **Reason:** matching upstream's plane-0 selection preserves
  byte-parity; exposing the other planes would require either
  decoding + merging (changes our tile-passthrough contract) or
  per-plane bytes (no obvious API). Both Leica fixtures hit this on
  tiled levels.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/formats/ome.md`](formats/ome.md).

### OME first-strip-only on multi-strip OneFrame (since v0.6)

- **Upstream:** Python opentile's `_read_frame(0)` consumes only
  strip 0 (plane 0 row 0 on `PlanarConfiguration=2`) and lets
  libjpeg-turbo's `TJERR_WARNING` recover from the truncated scan.
- **opentile-go:** sets `oneframe.Options.FirstStripOnly` on OME
  pages. Our cgo `tjTransform` wrapper distinguishes warning from
  fatal via `tjGetErrorCode` and treats warnings as success when the
  output is populated.
- **Reason:** byte parity for OneFrame levels of OME files (Leica-1
  L2-L4, Leica-2 L2-L5).
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/formats/ome.md`](formats/ome.md).

### BIF: probability map exposure (since v0.7)

- **Upstream:** Python opentile doesn't read BIF at all; v0.7 is the
  first opentile-go format beyond upstream's coverage. openslide
  exposes only `macro` and `thumbnail` from BIF — the IFD-1 tissue
  probability map (LZW grayscale, spec-compliant DP 200 only) is
  dropped.
- **opentile-go:** surfaces the probability map as
  `AssociatedImage.Kind() == "probability"`. Joins the existing
  `overview` / `macro` / `thumbnail` / `label` / `map` kind taxonomy
  via the new `kind="probability"` enum value.
- **Reason:** the slide author embedded the probability map; throwing
  it away is value loss. Consumers that don't recognise the kind
  iterate-and-skip cleanly via the existing `Associated()` API.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/formats/bif.md`](formats/bif.md).

### BIF: tile overlap exposed via `Level.TileOverlap()` (since v0.7)

- **Upstream:** Python opentile doesn't read BIF; openslide exposes
  per-pair `TileJointInfo` overlap as `tile_advance_x` /
  `tile_advance_y` properties (level-0 only) and silently composes
  overlapping tiles into the `read_region` output.
- **opentile-go:** new `Level.TileOverlap() image.Point` method on
  the public `Level` interface returns the per-tile-step pixel
  overlap (count-weighted average of all `<TileJointInfo>` entries on
  level 0; zero on pyramid IFDs 1+ which never overlap per spec).
  Non-BIF formats return `image.Point{}` — additive evolution; no
  caller change needed.
- **Reason:** `Level.Tile(c, r)` continues to return raw compressed
  bytes (preserving the byte-passthrough hot path), so the consumer
  needs the overlap value to position tiles correctly. Surface as
  metadata, not as a pixel-space crop.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/formats/bif.md`](formats/bif.md).

### BIF: non-strict `ScannerModel` acceptance (since v0.7)

- **Upstream:** the Roche BIF whitepaper explicitly mandates
  rejecting any slide whose IFD-0 `<iScan>/@ScannerModel` is not
  `"VENTANA DP 200"` ("Stop processing the BIF-file if the string
  does not match model name").
- **opentile-go:** accepts any iScan-tagged BigTIFF and routes
  internally based on `strings.HasPrefix(scannerModel, "VENTANA DP")`:
  spec-compliant path (DP 200, DP 600, future DP scanners) vs.
  legacy-iScan path (missing attribute, iScan Coreo, iScan HT).
- **Reason:** rejecting legacy iScan slides leaves users with a
  worse-than-openslide experience for that population. Both fixtures
  in our suite pass through Open cleanly with the prefix-match rule.
  DP 600 is not yet validated against a fixture but the prefix
  future-proofs against new DP scanners.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/formats/bif.md`](formats/bif.md); spec §4
  of the v0.7 design doc.

### Multi-dimensional WSI API addition (since v0.7)

- **Upstream:** Python opentile is 2D-only. Each format's pyramid is
  exposed as a flat list of levels with no Z/C/T axis support.
- **opentile-go:** adds cross-format multi-dim addressing —
  `Level.TileAt(TileCoord)` plus
  `Image.SizeZ/SizeC/SizeT/ChannelName/ZPlaneFocus`. Backward
  compatible: 2D-only formats (SVS / NDPI / Philips) inherit defaults
  from `SingleImage` (returning 1 / 1 / 1 / "" / 0); BIF surfaces
  `IMAGE_DEPTH`-driven multi-Z reads via the new API; OME honestly
  reports `<Pixels SizeZ/SizeC/SizeT>` dimension counts and rejects
  `TileAt(z != 0)` with `ErrDimensionUnavailable` until the per-IFD
  multi-Z reader lands as a separate format-package milestone.
- **Reason:** modern WSI consumers — fluorescence imaging, focal-
  plane viewers, time-series microscopy — need explicit multi-dim
  addressing. Designed cross-format-extensible so OME multi-Z,
  fluorescence, and time-series support land additively without
  re-shaping the API. Q1–Q6 sign-off captured in spec §13 of the
  multi-dim design doc.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim-design.md)
  + [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim.md).

### Non-TIFF dispatch path (since v0.8)

- **Upstream:** Python opentile dispatches all format detection
  through a single TIFF-parsed entry point — every supported format
  (SVS / NDPI / Philips / OME / 3DHistech) is a TIFF dialect.
- **opentile-go:** adds `FormatFactory.SupportsRaw(io.ReaderAt,
  int64) bool` and `OpenRaw(r, size, *Config) (Tiler, error)` that
  run *before* `tiff.Open`. A `RawUnsupported` zero-impl base
  struct embedded into the existing five TIFF factories returns
  `false` / `ErrUnsupportedFormat` so backward compatibility is
  zero-cost.
- **Reason:** Iris IFE is the first non-TIFF format opentile-go
  reads (v0.8); the table-driven dispatch lets each format own its
  detection rather than wiring magic-byte sniffs into
  `opentile.Open` directly. Future non-TIFF formats (DICOM-WSI,
  vendor-specific containers) drop in additively.
- **Tracking:** see [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-opentile-go-ife-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-opentile-go-ife-design.md) §3.

### IFE: TILE_TABLE x_extent / y_extent ignored (since v0.8)

- **Upstream:** the Iris IFE v1.0 spec doc claims `TILE_TABLE.x_extent`
  / `y_extent` carry "image width/height in pixels at top resolution
  layer."
- **opentile-go:** ignores those fields for level dimensions. The
  `cervix_2x_jpeg.iris` fixture (the only public IFE we have)
  stores `x_extent=496, y_extent=345` — exact matches for the
  native layer's `LAYER_EXTENTS.x_tiles=496, y_tiles≈346`, i.e.
  **tile counts, not pixels** as the spec doc claims. The reader
  derives image pixel dims from `native_layer.x_tiles ×
  TileSidePixels` instead.
- **Reason:** spec ambiguity. Either the doc's "pixels" wording is
  wrong or the cervix file is non-conforming; without a second
  fixture we can't tell. Driving size from `LAYER_EXTENTS` is
  unambiguous and matches what the reader needs anyway.
- **Tracking:** T3 gate (commit `d597755`) recorded the surprise.

## 2. Active limitations (open after v0.3)

Real behaviour gaps that have not been closed. Each entry's **Severity**
field declares whether it's a permanent design choice (the library
cannot reasonably address it without breaking compatibility) or a
v0.4 work-item (a real fix is queued for the existing-format
completeness milestone). Items closed during v0.3 are listed in §5.

### L4 — MPP may be absent from some slides' ImageDescription
- **Source:** diagnostic run during Task 20
- **Severity:** Permanent — input-data-dependent. The library cannot fabricate MPP values that the slide doesn't carry; callers must handle the zero case.
- **Detail:** CMU-1 embeds `MPP = 0.4990` in its ImageDescription, but not every Aperio slide does. When absent, `svs.Metadata.MPP` is zero and every Level's `MPP()` returns `SizeMm{0, 0}`. No bug, but a caller who expects non-zero MPP should check `SizeMm.IsZero()` rather than assuming a value.

### L5 — `internal/tiff` peeks at NDPI-specific tag to select IFD layout
- **Source:** Architecture audit (post-Batch 4)
- **Severity:** Permanent — design decision. NDPI files share classic TIFF magic 42 with no header-level distinguisher, so something has to peek to dispatch the NDPI-layout walker. The peek is encapsulated in `sniffNDPI` (see N-9 godoc on that function).
- **Detail:** `internal/tiff/file.go` reads tag 65420 (Hamamatsu NDPI FileFormat) in the first IFD to decide whether to dispatch the NDPI-layout IFD walker. A cleaner split would have `tiff.Open` expose a generic "layout" hint and let format packages drive selection — but that requires callers to know NDPI exists, which inverts the dependency. Revisit only if adding Philips/OME forces a more general dialect-detection scheme.

### L14 — NDPI label synthesis is Go-specific; Python opentile does not expose NDPI labels
- **Source:** Batch 7 parity oracle extension
- **Severity:** Permanent — deliberate Go-side extension. Removable via `WithNDPISynthesizedLabel(false)` (the v0.3 N-5 fix); see `formats/ndpi/synthlabel_test.go` for the opt-out path.
- **Detail:** Python opentile 0.20.0's `NdpiTiler.labels` returns an empty
  list — the upstream library does not surface a "label" AssociatedImage
  for NDPI slides. Our Go implementation synthesizes one by cropping the
  left 30% of the overview page (`formats/ndpi.newLabelImage`,
  `formats/ndpi/associated.go`), matching a convention common in Aperio
  SVS but with no upstream NDPI precedent.

  The Batch 7 parity test accommodates this by treating a zero-length
  Python oracle output as "skip"; downstream consumers inspecting
  `Tiler.Associated()` on an NDPI slide will see a `Kind() == "label"`
  entry our Go side provides and Python's does not. Not a bug, but a
  deliberate Go-side extension that callers switching between the two
  languages should know about.

  *How to fix if we decide it's unwanted:* drop the `newLabelImage` call
  in `formats/ndpi/ndpi.go` Open() so NDPI associated is overview-only.
  Or keep it and add a README note calling it out.

### L19 — BIF: openslide pixel-parity oracle gated, infrastructure shipped (since v0.7)
- **Source:** Batch E execution (T20)
- **Severity:** v0.8 — work item, not permanent. The runner / session
  / protocol all work; the test currently `t.Skip`s with a clear gap
  description. Resolving requires either an opentile-go-side
  AOI-cropped Tile variant or a clearer story about which view is
  authoritative.
- **Detail:** opentile-go's `Tile(col, row)` at level N references
  the **padded TIFF grid** (e.g. OS-1 L5 = 3712×3192) — what the
  TIFF tags actually cover. openslide's `read_region` references the
  **AOI hull** (OS-1 L5 = 3307×2936) — cropped per the spec's
  "padding to top and right" clause. Their `(0, 0)` tiles map to
  different physical regions, so any pixel comparison diverges by
  construction. Anecdotal note from a community reader: openslide is
  also believed to misread *modern* (DP 200+) BIF — Ventana-1's
  `Direction="LEFT"` rejection is one example, and OS-1 readback may
  have its own quirks. Net effect: openslide pixel-equivalence isn't
  load-bearing for v0.7 correctness; tifffile (Ventana-1) +
  committed sample-tile SHAs (both fixtures) are the references that
  matter.

### L20 — BIF: DP 600 and other future "VENTANA DP *" scanners unverified (since v0.7)
- **Source:** v0.7 design spec §10
- **Severity:** v0.8+ — input-data-dependent. The
  `strings.HasPrefix(scannerModel, "VENTANA DP")` rule lands future
  DP scanners on the spec-compliant path automatically; if a real
  DP 600 (or later) fixture surfaces a behavioural difference (Z-stack
  default, varying overlap distribution, new XMP attributes), it'll
  be a deviation to fold into §1a above.

~~### L21 — BIF: volumetric Z-stacks deferred to v0.8+ (since v0.7)~~
**Closed in v0.7 multi-dim closeout (2026-04-29).** Volumetric BIF
slides now expose every focal plane via the new public
`Image.SizeZ()` + `Level.TileAt(TileCoord{Z, ...})` API — see the
multi-dim deviation in §1a + the multi-dim retirement subsection
of §8a below. Synthetic-fixture coverage only (no real volumetric
BIF in `sample_files/`). The work was executed sequentially on
2026-04-29 across 19 plan tasks.

~~### L22 — IFE: METADATA block parsing deferred (since v0.8)~~
**Closed in v0.8 metadata closeout (2026-05-01).** `formats/ife/`
now parses METADATA + ATTRIBUTES + IMAGE_ARRAY + ICC_PROFILE (skips
ANNOTATIONS). `Tiler.Metadata()` surfaces magnification from the
header; `Tiler.ICCProfile()` returns the embedded color profile;
`Tiler.Associated()` exposes the IMAGE_ARRAY entries with normalised
kinds ("thumbnail" / "label" / "overview" / "macro" / "map" /
"probability"; unknown titles surface lowercased). New
`ife.MetadataOf(tiler)` accessor returns IFE-specific fields:
`MicronsPerPixel`, `MagnificationFromHeader`, `CodecMajor/Minor/Build`,
`AttributesFormat`, `Attributes map[string]string`. Cervix surfaces
24 free-form attributes (every original "aperio.*" / "tiff.*" key
the source SVS carried before the Iris re-encode) + a 6064-byte ICC
profile + a 1920×1337 JPEG thumbnail. ANNOTATIONS parsing tracked as
L25 below — fixture-driven; cervix has no annotations.

### L25 — IFE: ANNOTATIONS block parsing deferred (since v0.8)
- **Source:** v0.8 metadata closeout follow-on.
- **Severity:** v0.9+ work — fixture-driven; trigger when a real
  IFE file with annotations surfaces.
- IFE v1.0 defines an ANNOTATIONS block carrying per-region polygon
  / rectangle / ellipse / freehand annotations + grouping metadata.
  The v0.8 reader skips the block (validates the offset is in-bounds
  but doesn't parse contents). Cervix carries
  `annotations_offset == NULL_OFFSET`.
- **Resolution path:** add `ife.Annotation` types + a parse helper.
  Likely a new exported field on `ife.Metadata` so the cross-format
  `opentile.Tiler.Metadata()` stays simple. Estimate: a half day
  given the nesting (ANNOTATION_ENTRY × N + ANNOTATION_BYTES +
  ANNOTATION_GROUP_SIZES + ANNOTATION_GROUP_BYTES).

### L23 — IFE: cross-tool parity vs `tile_server_iris` deferred (since v0.8)
- **Source:** v0.8 IFE design spec §7.
- **Severity:** v0.9+ work — IFE shipped with sample-tile SHA fixtures
  + synthetic-writer unit tests as the correctness bar; cross-tool
  byte-equality vs `tile_server_iris` HTTP output remains a future
  follow-up.
- IFE has no Python analogue (tifffile / opentile-py don't read it),
  so v0.7's tifffile + opentile parity oracles don't port. Coverage
  is `TestSlideParity` SHA hashes against `cervix_2x_jpeg.ife.json`
  + `tests/parity/ife_geometry_test.go` per-fixture pinning + the
  synthetic writer in `formats/ife/synthetic_test.go`. The first
  divergence story (opentile-go produces byte X, consumer Y observes
  byte Z) is debugged from scratch.
- **Resolution path:** if a downstream divergence surfaces, write a
  shell-out runner that fetches tiles from `tile_server_iris` HTTP
  and compares to `Level.Tile(c, r)` byte-for-byte. Same shape as
  the v0.7 openslide oracle, cross-language.

### L24 — IFE: AVIF + Iris-proprietary tile decode is consumer's responsibility (since v0.8)
- **Source:** v0.8 IFE design spec §10 Q9.
- **Severity:** Permanent — design choice. opentile-go is a
  byte-passthrough library by design; AVIF and Iris-proprietary
  codecs are no different from JPEG/JP2K in that respect.
- IFE tiles can be encoded as JPEG (decodable via stdlib),
  AVIF (consumer links libavif or `golang.org/x/image/avif` when
  stdlib gains it), or the Iris-proprietary codec (consumer
  embeds an Iris codec or 501s the request). opentile-go reports
  `CompressionAVIF` / `CompressionIRIS` so consumers know the
  codec without trying decode and discovering by failure.
- **Resolution path:** none. Linking libavif or an Iris codec into
  opentile-go would expand the cgo footprint past `internal/jpegturbo/`
  and break the byte-passthrough contract that v0.1's `Level.Tile`
  established.

## 3. Reviewer suggestions accepted but not applied

Non-blocking items raised during per-task spec / quality review. The v0.3
batch closed every suggestion in this section; see §6 for the retired list.
Future review cycles re-populate this section.

---

## 4. v0.2 session learnings (process notes)

These are not deferred items — they're observations about how v0.2 development went, kept here so future sessions have context.

- **The "don't guess — read upstream" rule was established mid-session** (commit `993289e`). Codified in CLAUDE.md and in the cross-session memory system (`feedback_no_guessing.md`). Prompted by three separate "guess-and-regret" debugging cycles in v0.2 (NDPI IFD layout, NDPI metadata tag numbers, StripOffsets tag number) and reinforced by two more in Batch 6/7 (NDPI striped vs. oneframe gate on tag 322 — L13; APP14 bytes miscopied — now canonical). Future format work should read upstream first and commit behavior from there.

- **Architecture audit at end of Batch 4** — three minor cleanups landed (NDPI tiler struct consolidated into `tiler.go`, SVS `image.go` renamed to `tiled.go`, stale debug artifacts removed). Full decision trail in commit `cae47cd`.

- **"Does the slide open?" is not a sufficient NDPI smoke test (L13).** The original `formats/ndpi/striped.go` gated on TIFF tag 322 (TileWidth), which NDPI pages never carry. Every pyramid level fell through to `oneFrameImage`'s per-tile whole-level tjTransform — 3000× slower than Python opentile for CMU-1.ndpi L0, but every unit and integration test still passed because they only verified `Open()` + tile counts, never per-tile throughput. Caught during Batch 6 when fixture generation hit a 30-minute timeout on a 188 MB slide. `formats/ndpi/bench_test.go` is now a regression gate that exercises per-tile time under `NDPI_BENCH_SLIDE`.

- **Byte parity is a stronger correctness bar than it first appears (Batch 7).** The parity oracle was originally scoped as a best-effort opt-in check; extending it to `Associated.Bytes()` surfaced two latent divergences in `internal/jpeg/ConcatenateScans` (APP14 byte values and segment ordering) that no other test caught — both produced valid JPEGs, both decoded to correct pixels, both self-consistent inside our own fixtures. Only byte-level comparison against Python opentile surfaced them. Lesson: "decodes to the right pixels" is not synonymous with "correct output" when downstream consumers (wsidicomizer, DICOM pipelines) may hash the output.

- **Parity with an unconfigured upstream has hidden dimensions (Batch 7).** Python opentile 0.20.0's `OpenTile.open(slide, tile_size)` expects `int`, not `(w, h)`; passing a tuple silently worked for SVS and raised `TypeError` from NDPI's adjust_tile_size. Two separate parity agents hit this. The v0.2 runner pins `tile_size: int` and documents the quirk.

- **tjTransform's CUSTOMFILTER callback is not bitwise-deterministic across Go/Python (L12).** Same flags (`TJXOPT_PERFECT | TJXOPT_CROP`), same callback output, same source JPEG → subtly different entropy streams for NDPI edge tiles. Verified our DC coefficient math matches Python's (`round((lum * 2047 - 1024) / dc_quant) = 170` for luminance=1.0 on CMU-1.ndpi L0's DQT=6), AC is untouched on both sides. Root cause unknown; see L12 for v0.3+ debugging plan.

**N-numbered items closed as not-applicable (architecture changed since plan was written):**

- **I4 / N-? (Assembler)** — Plan proposed an `Assembler` type to precompute the JPEG header prefix per level. NDPI striped already amortises the prefix work via per-frameSize header caching in `getPatchedHeader`; SVS associated `Bytes()` is called rarely enough that per-call overhead doesn't show in profiles. The optimisation didn't apply.
- **I5** — Plan proposed a defensive RSTn count check requiring "exactly 1 RSTn per fragment." Aperio SVS strips legitimately carry multiple internal RSTn markers (one per encoder restart-interval row); enforcing exactly-1 would error on valid inputs.
- **N-10** — Plan proposed inverting striped Tile()'s Crop fall-through to choose the helper up front by geometry. The `extendsBeyond` heuristic is broader than "Crop errored," so the inversion changes which tiles take the OOB-fill code path → different bytes via a different libjpeg-turbo transform path. Reverted with an inline comment naming the divergence (`acc2282`).

---

## 6. Retired in v0.4

Items closed during the v0.4 existing-format completeness milestone.
One line per ID; named commit's message has the full rationale and
the test that locks the change in.

**Limitations (L-prefix):**

- **L6** — NDPI Map pages (`mag == -2.0`) surface as `AssociatedImage` with `Kind() == "map"` (`7ac3f88`, paired with R13). OS-2.ndpi page 11 and Hamamatsu-1.ndpi page 7 exposed as 8-bit grayscale uncompressed strip-passthrough; CMU-1.ndpi unchanged (no Map page). Deliberate Go-side extension paralleling L14 — Python opentile does not expose Map pages even though tifffile classifies them as `series.name == 'Map'`.
- **L12** — NDPI edge-tile OOB fill (`f4c647b`). Control-flow bug, not the "tjTransform CUSTOMFILTER non-determinism" the v0.2/v0.3 entry claimed. `formats/ndpi/striped.go::Tile` now dispatches geometry-first against image size (matching Python's `__need_fill_background` gate at `turbojpeg.py:839-863`); pre-v0.4 it tried plain `Crop` first and silently returned mid-gray OOB fills on edge tiles where Crop happened to succeed. CMU-1 + OS-2 + Hamamatsu-1 NDPI fixtures regenerated; parity oracle's L12 `t.Logf` carve-out removed in the same commit. Every NDPI tile now byte-equal to Python opentile.
- **L17** — NDPI label cropH passes full image height (`bdaa44e`). One-line `cropH` change in `formats/ndpi/associated.go::newLabelImage` plus dropping the now-unused `mcuH` argument. Matches Python's `_crop_parameters[3] = page.shape[0]` at `ndpi_image.py:144`; libjpeg-turbo's `TJXOPT_PERFECT` accepts the partial last MCU row when the crop ends at the image edge. The pre-v0.4 entry's "needs CropWithBackground" advice was wrong (incomplete read of upstream).

**Roadmap items (R-prefix):**

- **R13** — NDPI Map pages exposed as associated images (`7ac3f88`, paired with L6).

**JIT verification gates (Tasks 1-4 of the v0.4 plan):**

- **T1** — JP2K determinism gate (`c27d9f8`): byte-deterministic. R4's done-when bar (when it lands) is byte-parity with Python opentile.
- **T2** — NDPI Map fixture audit (`e6bbcd5`): OS-2 + Hamamatsu-1 carry Map pages; tifffile classifies them, Python opentile chooses not to surface them. Validated the L6 / R13 path.
- **T3** — L12 reproduction shape (`1b651bf`): Case D — control-flow bug in our Go-side dispatch (the plan offered Cases A/B/C; the actual finding was sharper). Drove the L12 fix above.
- **T4** — R4 mechanism audit (`d2fe107`): port notes at `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-04-26-svs-reconstruct-port.md`. Identified that R4 pulls in 4 new pieces of cgo + Pillow-port infrastructure for a feature whose only test would be synthetic. Drove the v0.4 → v0.5+ deferral of R4 / R9 to issue [#1](https://github.com/cornish/opentile-go/issues/1).

**Deferred (not retired, but resolved by punting to a tracked issue):**

- **R4** (SVS corrupt-edge reconstruct) and **R9** (JP2K decode/encode) — moved from v0.4 to v0.5+ on 2026-04-26. Filed as [#1](https://github.com/cornish/opentile-go/issues/1) with the full upstream algorithm, Go-side dependency tree, byte-parity bar, and trigger conditions for picking the work back up. Audit confirmed none of our 5 local SVS slides exhibit the corrupt-edge bug; 12 tasks of speculative cgo work for a synthetic-fixture-only feature didn't pass the project's "fix bugs we can demonstrate, don't write defensive code for hypothetical inputs" rule.

## 7. Retired in v0.5

Items closed during the v0.5 Philips TIFF milestone. One line per ID;
named commits' messages have the full rationale and the parity check
that locks the change in.

**Roadmap items (R-prefix):**

- **R5** — Philips TIFF support landed end-to-end (`1ad463c..7e7bde0`).
  New `formats/philips/` package, new `internal/jpegturbo.FillFrame`
  cgo entry point, new `internal/jpeg.InsertTables` (no-APP14 sibling
  to `InsertTablesAndAPP14`). All 4 sample fixtures
  (`Philips-{1,2,3,4}.tiff`) open cleanly: byte-identical to Python
  opentile 0.20.0 across every sampled tile and every associated
  image we expose. Parity oracle slate extended (11 slides total);
  integration suite covers all 12 fixtures (5 SVS + 3 NDPI + 4
  Philips) green on every commit.

**JIT verification gates (Tasks 1-3 of the v0.5 plan):**

- **T1** — `is_philips` detection gate (`f3ac48c`): all 4 Philips
  fixtures match upstream's `software[:10] == 'Philips DP'` AND
  `description[-16:].strip().endswith('</DataObject>')` rule; zero
  false positives across 13 non-Philips fixtures. No detection-rule
  refinement needed.
- **T2** — `FillFrame` determinism gate (`aa49f96`): Python's
  `Jpeg.fill_frame(src, 1.0)` is byte-deterministic across 5 passes
  (sha256 `05c3789cc691d9a207659e250b3fc9c799eca7c5019c4b084a441c4dca9da243`,
  2,364 bytes). Set the v0.5 sparse-tile blank-tile bar to byte
  equality. Cross-check during the FillFrame implementation (commit
  `e5ae3ac`) confirmed our Go `FillFrame` produces the SAME sha on
  the same input.
- **T3** — DICOM XML schema audit (`17cce32`): 11 DICOM_* tags
  inventoried across 4 fixtures. `DICOM_ACQUISITION_DATETIME` and
  `DICOM_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER` absent on 3/4 fixtures (Philips-4
  only); multi-value strings (DICOM_SOFTWARE_VERSIONS,
  DICOM_LOSSY_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_*) are space-separated quoted. Drove
  the metadata parser's per-tag tolerant-of-absence design.

**Mid-task discoveries (where reading upstream changed the design):**

- The v0.5 plan's `computeCorrectedSizes` test expectation was based
  on a misread of `tifffile._philips_load_pages` (assumed N PS
  entries → N corrected sizes including baseline). Reading upstream
  byte-by-byte (the easily-missed `i += 1` at line 6540) corrected
  this: N PS entries → N-1 corrected sizes, with the first PS entry
  calibrating only.
- The synthesised-XML metadata tests passed under a flat
  `encoding/xml` schema, but the real Philips fixtures wrap
  level-specific Attributes inside `PIM_DP_SCANNED_IMAGES > Array >
  DataObject`. Smoke test against real fixtures forced a rewrite to
  a stack-based token decoder mirroring
  `ElementTree.iter('Attribute')`.
- `NativeTiledTiffImage.get_tile` always splices JPEGTables onto
  whatever `_read_frame` returns, including the cached blank tile
  (which already has tables inside `FillFrame`'s input). Result is
  duplicate DQT/DHT segments in the sparse-tile output — JPEG
  decoders accept this. Cross-check against Python at Philips-4 L0
  (0,0) caught our initial single-splice version.

---

## 8b. Retired in v0.8

Items closed during the v0.8 Iris IFE milestone — the first non-TIFF
format opentile-go reads, the first format beyond what's even
adjacent to upstream Python opentile's coverage (BIF in v0.7 was
WSI but not in upstream's slate; IFE is bleeding-edge with no
upstream comparison at all). Branch `feat/v0.8`.

**Roadmap items (R-prefix):**

- **R18** — Iris IFE support landed end-to-end. New `formats/ife/`
  package (FILE_HEADER + TILE_TABLE + LAYER_EXTENTS + TILE_OFFSETS
  parsing, layer-ordering inversion, sparse-tile sentinel via
  `ErrSparseTile`, encoding-enum mapping). Plumbing refactor
  (`FormatFactory.SupportsRaw` + `OpenRaw` + `RawUnsupported` base)
  ships alongside; new `Compression` enum values `CompressionAVIF`
  and `CompressionIRIS` surface so consumers know what they're
  getting. One real fixture (`cervix_2x_jpeg.iris`, 2.16 GB,
  JPEG-encoded). Round-trips through `opentile.OpenFile` cleanly:
  9 levels native-first, 256×256 tiles, JPEG SOI markers on every
  decoded tile.

**Active limitations (L-prefix):**

- **L22** — IFE METADATA block parsing. **Closed mid-v0.8
  (2026-05-01).** `formats/ife/` gained a full metadata reader
  covering METADATA + ATTRIBUTES + IMAGE_ARRAY + ICC_PROFILE.
  `Tiler.Metadata() / ICCProfile() / Associated()` all populate
  for IFE; new `ife.MetadataOf(tiler)` exposes the IFE-specific
  bag (MPP, codec version, free-form attributes map).
  ANNOTATIONS parsing carried forward as L25 — fixture-driven.
- **L23** (cross-tool parity), **L24** (AVIF/Iris decode), and
  the new **L25** (ANNOTATIONS) tracked in §2 above.

**JIT verification gates (Batch A of the v0.8 plan):**

- **T1** — magic bytes + endianness gate (`16907ef`):
  `cervix_2x_jpeg.iris` first 4 bytes are `0x73 0x69 0x72 0x49`,
  assemble as LE-uint32 to `0x49726973` exactly. Confirmed
  upstream's claim.
- **T2** — FILE_HEADER structure offsets gate (`f17ecee`): all 38
  bytes parse cleanly; `extension_major=1`, `file_size=2,161,105,409`
  matches stat, `tile_table_offset` and `metadata_offset` both
  within file bounds.
- **T3** — LAYER_EXTENTS layer ordering gate (`d597755`): 9 layers,
  scales `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]` strictly increasing —
  coarsest-first as the design's §6 inversion logic requires.
  **One surprise**: TILE_TABLE `x_extent=496, y_extent=345` look
  like tile counts (matches native layer's x_tiles=496) rather
  than pixels; reader filed against L22's neighbor and ignores the
  TILE_TABLE extents in favor of `LAYER_EXTENTS` math.
- **T4** — TILE_OFFSETS sparse-sentinel gate (`3f4b336`): 228,958
  entries = sum-of-tile-counts across all 9 layers; 40+24-bit
  encoding decodes cleanly; cervix has zero sparse entries
  (fully-tiled). Probe handles absence gracefully.

**Mid-task discoveries (where the cervix surprised us):**

- TILE_TABLE.x_extent / y_extent are tile counts, not pixels (T3).
  Logged as a deviation in §1a; reader derives image dims from
  `LAYER_EXTENTS` instead.
- Tile bytes are JPEG-prefixed (`ff d8 ff e0 ... JFIF ...`) rather
  than the abbreviated-scan format SVS / BIF use. Confirms the
  spec's claim that IFE tiles are self-contained — no JPEGTables
  splice needed in the reader, distinct from every other format
  opentile-go has shipped.
- Layer ordering inversion was the highest-risk gate (T3) but
  passed cleanly; §6 stands.

**Architecture invariants preserved:**

- Public API stable. Five new exported names (`opentile.FormatIFE`,
  `opentile.RawUnsupported`, `opentile.ErrSparseTile`,
  `opentile.CompressionAVIF`, `opentile.CompressionIRIS`).
- `FormatFactory` interface evolved additively — existing factories
  embed `RawUnsupported` to inherit defaults; no caller change.
- cgo footprint unchanged at `internal/jpegturbo/`. AVIF and Iris
  codecs are consumer's call.
- Lock-free hot path preserved — IFE Tiler builds metadata at Open
  time; `Tile()` is direct ReadAt against the cached `tileOffsets`
  slice.

**Plan cross-reference:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-opentile-go-v08-ife.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-opentile-go-v08-ife.md)
(19 tasks across Batches A–E).

---

## 8a. Retired in v0.7

Items closed during the v0.7 Ventana BIF milestone. The branch
spans `b2e7f53..f602b20` (30 commits across Batches A through F).

**Roadmap items (R-prefix):**

- **R14** — Ventana BIF support landed end-to-end. New
  `formats/bif/` package (detection, generation classification by
  `strings.HasPrefix(scannerModel, "VENTANA DP")`, IFD
  classification by ImageDescription content, serpentine remap,
  empty-tile blank fill, JPEGTables splice), new
  `internal/bifxml/` package (XMP walker for `<iScan>` and
  `<EncodeInfo>`), `Level.TileOverlap()` interface evolution.
  Two real fixtures (Ventana-1 spec-compliant + OS-1 legacy iScan)
  Open cleanly with full-tiler exposure: format, levels, associated
  images, ICC, metadata, MetadataOf.

**Active limitations (L-prefix):**

- **L21** — BIF volumetric Z-stacks. **Closed in v0.7 multi-dim
  closeout (2026-04-29).** Multi-Z BIF reads now exposed via
  `Image.SizeZ()` + `Level.TileAt(TileCoord{Z, ...})` — see the
  multi-dim retirement subsection below.

Carried forward to v0.8+: L19 (openslide pixel-parity gap,
infrastructure-only), L20 (DP 600 unverified — fixture-dependent).

**Mid-task discoveries (where execution surfaced design surprises):**

- **Both real fixtures have NON-ZERO TileOverlap on level 0**
  (Ventana-1 L0=(2,0); OS-1 L0=(18,26)) — the design spec §10's
  claim of "fixture-untested overlap path" was wrong. The notes file
  §2 reported "all zero" based on a 1500-char XMP truncation; the
  full XMP carries a sparse mix of zero and non-zero `<TileJointInfo>`
  entries. The weighted-average path is therefore exercised by real
  data, not just synthetic tests. Updated v0.7 spec §10 + this
  retirement note.
- **OS-1 has no ICC profile** (tag 34675 present with count=0) —
  the notes file §2 claimed the tag was present on both fixtures.
  T18 distinguishes "tag-absent" from "tag-present-with-zero-bytes"
  and returns nil for both.
- **OS-1 has no FrameInfo / Frame XMP elements** at all (predates
  that XMP feature). T7's `internal/bifxml` parser handles this
  gracefully via empty `Frames` slices; T13's serpentine algorithm
  works without Frame data on this fixture.
- **opentile-go's image extent ≠ openslide's image extent for OS-1**
  (3712×3192 vs 3307×2936 at L5). opentile-go reports the padded
  TIFF grid; openslide reports the AOI hull. Their `(0, 0)` tiles
  reference different physical regions. Recorded as L19; resolution
  deferred to v0.8.
- **Two correctness bugs caught by writing the integration test
  (T19), not by any synthetic unit test:**
  (a) `loadEncodeInfo` was silently swallowing
  `bifxml.ParseEncodeInfo`'s Ver<2 error, defeating the
  spec-mandated rejection gate;
  (b) `bif.MetadataOf` didn't unwrap the file-closer Tiler returned
  by `opentile.OpenFile`, so `MetadataOf(opentile.OpenFile(slide))`
  always returned `(nil, false)`.

**Process notes:**

- v0.7 was executed sequentially (no subagents) for Batches C/D/E/F
  per user instruction — the user is on remote control and the
  back-and-forth latency of subagent dispatch + dual-stage review
  was a worse fit than direct execution. Subagents (haiku for
  mechanical tasks, sonnet for design-aware tasks) were used for
  Batches A and B only; review-cycle catches there were a count
  typo (T1), an OME-XMP→BIF-XMP typo in the T4 outcome paragraph,
  and an over-prescriptive sentence in T5. Useful but not
  load-bearing.

### v0.7 multi-dim closeout (2026-04-29)

After the initial v0.7 BIF milestone landed (commits
`b2e7f53..f602b20`), the user grew v0.7's scope to cover
cross-format multi-dimensional WSI abstractions — driven by L21
(BIF Z-stacks) plus the forward-looking goal of supporting OME
multi-Z, fluorescence, and time-series WSI without re-shaping the
public API again.

Design + plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim-design.md` +
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-opentile-go-multidim.md`. 19
plan tasks across 5 batches, executed sequentially.

**Active limitations closed:**

- **L21** — BIF volumetric Z-stacks. Multi-Z BIF reads now exposed
  via `Image.SizeZ()` + `Level.TileAt(TileCoord{Z, ...})`.
  Synthetic-fixture coverage (no real volumetric BIF in
  `sample_files/`).

**API additions (cross-format infrastructure):**

- `TileCoord{X, Y, Z, C, T}` struct + `ErrDimensionUnavailable`
  error sentinel.
- `Level.TileAt(TileCoord) ([]byte, error)` on the `Level`
  interface — additive; existing `Tile(x, y)` unchanged.
- `Image.SizeZ() / SizeC() / SizeT() / ChannelName(c) /
  ZPlaneFocus(z)` on the `Image` interface — additive; defaults
  on `SingleImage` return 1 / 1 / 1 / "" / 0.
- `bif.Metadata.ZSpacing + ZPlaneFoci` for format-specific
  consumers reaching through `bif.MetadataOf(tiler)`.

**Format-specific additions:**

- BIF: per-IFD `IMAGE_DEPTH` (32997) read at construction; tile
  array stride `Z * (cols*rows) + serpIdx`; `<iScan>/@Z-spacing`
  drives `ZPlaneFocus(z)` per BIF whitepaper §"Whole slide imaging
  process" layout (Z=0 nominal, Z=1..nNear near focus,
  Z=nNear+1..N-1 far focus).
- OME: honest `<Pixels SizeZ/SizeT>` reporting; `<Channel>` element
  count discriminates `SizeC()` from `<Pixels SizeC>` (= per-pixel
  RGB sample count, not separately-stored channels — both Leica
  fixtures correctly report `SizeC() == 1`).

**Mid-task discoveries:**

- T2 surfaced the `<Pixels SizeC>` vs `<Channel>`-count
  discrimination question. Without it, every brightfield OME
  fixture would have been misreported as 3-channel
  multi-fluorescence.
- T4 + T8: Distinguishing `ErrDimensionUnavailable` (axis doesn't
  exist on this slide) vs `ErrTileOutOfBounds` (axis exists but
  index past size) caught a subtle BIF check that initially
  returned the wrong sentinel for `imageDepth=1` + `Z=1`.
- T12: existing `formats/ome/metadata_test.go` golden assertions
  needed updates because the parser previously dropped
  SizeZ/C/T silently — exposing them honestly was a behavioural
  change at the test surface.

**OME deferral (carried forward):**

- Multi-Z OME `TileAt(z != 0)` returns `ErrDimensionUnavailable`
  until the per-IFD reader lands. The dimensions are surfaced
  honestly so consumers can detect multi-Z OMEs and gracefully
  fall back. Implementation strategy documented in
  `docs/formats/ome.md`'s "Future implementation strategy"
  subsection.

**Test fixtures:**

All 16 existing 2D fixtures pass `TestMultiDimCompat2D` (Tile and
TileAt byte-identical at level-0 (0,0); SizeZ/C/T == 1; non-zero
Z/C/T returns `ErrDimensionUnavailable`). BIF multi-Z synthetic
fixtures cover 1, 3, 5 plane stacks plus edge cases (depth=0/1,
depth=4 even, zero spacing). 11 multi-Z-specific tests in
`formats/bif/multiz_test.go`.

## 8. Retired in v0.6

Items closed during the v0.6 OME TIFF milestone. One line per ID;
named commits' messages have the full rationale and the parity check
that locks the change in.

**Roadmap items (R-prefix):**

- **R7** — OME TIFF support landed end-to-end. New `formats/ome/`
  package, new `internal/tiff` SubIFD support (`Page.SubIFDOffsets`
  + `File.PageAtOffset`), new public API (`Image` interface +
  `Tiler.Images()`), shared `internal/oneframe` package factored
  from NDPI. Both Leica fixtures (Leica-1, Leica-2) open cleanly:
  byte-identical to Python opentile 0.20.0 + tifffile across every
  Image / level / sampled position we expose. Multi-image deviation
  exposes Leica-2's 4 main pyramids; the 3 dropped by upstream are
  byte-validated via the new tifffile oracle.

**Public API additions:**

- `Image` interface (Index / Name / Levels / Level / MPP).
- `Tiler.Images() []Image` — always ≥ 1 entry; multi-image OME
  exposes multiple. Existing `Tiler.Levels()` / `Level(i)` continue
  to work as documented shortcuts to `Images()[0]`.
- `opentile.SingleImage` helper used by SVS / NDPI / Philips for the
  one-element wrapper.
- `opentile.FormatOME` constant.

**Internal additions:**

- `internal/tiff.TagSubIFDs` constant (TIFF tag 330) +
  `Page.SubIFDOffsets()` accessor.
- `internal/tiff.File.PageAtOffset(off)` for SubIFD traversal.
  `scalarU32` falls through to `Values64` for BigTIFF LONG8/IFD8
  scalar values (caught while wiring SubIFD reads on Leica
  fixtures — `ImageWidth` / `ImageLength` were silently failing).
- `internal/oneframe/` package — factored from
  `formats/ndpi/oneframe.go`; serves NDPI + OME (and likely v0.7
  BIF). New `Options.FirstStripOnly` flag for OME multi-strip
  planar pages.
- `internal/jpegturbo` cgo wrapper now distinguishes `TJERR_WARNING`
  from fatal via `tjGetErrorCode`; treats warnings as success when
  the output is populated. Required for OME OneFrame's truncated
  scan data; NDPI parity preserved.

**JIT verification gates (Tasks 1-5 of the v0.6 plan):**

- **T1** — `is_ome` detection gate (commit `b2950e6`): both Leica
  fixtures match `description[-10:].strip().endswith('OME>')`; zero
  false positives across 15 non-OME fixtures.
- **T2** — SubIFD parsing audit (commit `2b0a6cc`): SubIFDs reachable
  via tifffile's `series.levels`. Discovery: OneFrame levels are
  dominant (3 of 5 in Leica-1, 4 of 6 per Leica-2 main pyramid).
- **T3** — OneFrame factor decision (commit `72ba57f`): factor.
  NDPI's `oneframe.go` body is already format-agnostic.
- **T4** — OME-XML schema audit (commit `c807f8e`): both fixtures
  use namespace 2016-06; uniform µm units; uint8 type.
- **T5** — tifffile splice-replication harness (commit `e170766`):
  OME files have no shared JPEGTables on tested fixtures; opentile-py
  output is byte-identical to tifffile raw bytes for tiled levels.
  Refined parity strategy.

**Mid-task discoveries (where reading upstream changed the design):**

- **PlanarConfiguration=2 plane-0-only indexing**: discovered when our
  initial OME tile reader rejected Leica-1 L0 with "tile table
  mismatch: offsets=16416 ... grid=72x76". Python opentile silently
  uses plane 0 only via flat indexing; we matched for byte parity
  and added a deviation note.
- **Multi-strip OneFrame**: Leica-1 L2 has 7206 strips (3 planes × 2402
  rows); Python's `_read_frame(0)` consumes only strip 0. Forced the
  shared `oneframe.Options.FirstStripOnly` flag.
- **`tjTransform` warning vs fatal**: libjpeg-turbo raises
  TJERR_WARNING ("premature end of data segment") on OME OneFrame
  inputs whose SOF claims full-page dimensions but only strip 0 of
  scan data is present. Python tolerates the warning silently; we
  added warning-vs-fatal discrimination via `tjGetErrorCode`.

## 9. Gate outcomes (live)

JIT verification gate outcomes from the v0.4, v0.5, v0.6, and v0.7 plans.
Each gate decides a done-when bar or fix path for subsequent tasks.

### v0.7 multi-dim gates

#### Task 3 — BIF Z-spacing parsing gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-29
- **Outcome:** Both BIF fixtures carry `<iScan Z-layers="1"
  Z-spacing="1" ...>`. `internal/bifxml.IScan` already exposes
  `ZLayers int`; the parser already lists `"Z-layers"` in
  `knownIScanAttrs` and writes it into `s.ZLayers`. **`Z-spacing`
  is NOT yet a field on `IScan`** — the attribute is consumed by
  the parser (so it doesn't fall into `RawAttributes`) but no
  typed field receives it. T7 (Batch C) adds
  `IScan.ZSpacing float64` and the per-attribute case in
  `parseIScanAttrs`. Both fixture values (Z-spacing=1) are
  meaningless for single-plane scans (ZLayers=1); the field is
  load-bearing only when the synthetic multi-Z fixture builder in
  T10 produces a Z-stacked test slide. Add the field + parse +
  test in T7 before the BIF-side levelImpl wiring in T8.

#### Task 2 — OME `<Pixels>` SizeZ/C/T extraction gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-29
- **Outcome:** Both Leica fixtures (Leica-1.ome.tiff: 2 Images;
  Leica-2.ome.tiff: 5 Images) carry `<Pixels SizeZ="1" SizeC="3"
  SizeT="1" DimensionOrder="XYCZT">` on every Image. **`<Pixels
  SizeC=3>` describes RGB sample-count, NOT separately-stored
  channels** — every Image has exactly one `<Channel>` element,
  meaning the underlying tile bytes are a single composite RGB
  JPEG (the standard brightfield pathology layout). The right
  discriminator for `Image.SizeC()` (the new v0.7 multi-dim
  accessor) is **`<Channel>` element count**, not `<Pixels SizeC>`.
  T12 (Batch D) wires this through: `pyramidImage.SizeC()` reads
  the `<Channel>` count rather than `<Pixels SizeC>`. The current
  `omePixels` decode struct in `formats/ome/metadata.go` only
  parses SizeX/SizeY; it must grow `SizeZ/SizeC/SizeT` fields and
  the parser must additionally count `<Channel>` elements per
  Image. With this rule, every existing Leica fixture reports
  `SizeZ=SizeC=SizeT=1` — no false-positive multi-dim
  reclassification of brightfield slides.

#### Task 1 — IMAGE_DEPTH (32997) accessor gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-29
- **Outcome:** `internal/tiff.Page.ImageDepth()` returns `(1, false)` for every page on every fixture in the 17-fixture local set (5 SVS, 3 NDPI, 1 generic TIFF, 4 Philips TIFF, 2 OME-TIFF, 2 BIF — pages range from 2 (Leica-1) to 12 (OS-2.ndpi, OS-1.bif)). No fixture carries a volumetric Z-stack. Confirms (a) the accessor is fault-free on real data, (b) the BIF multi-Z code path **must be exercised exclusively via in-code synthetic fixtures** in `formats/bif/multiz_test.go` per the design spec Q5 sign-off. The choice to embed synthetic Z-stack fixtures in test source rather than committing binary testdata stands.

### v0.7 gates

#### Task 1 — Detection gate (`<iScan` substring)

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Outcome:** 2 BIF fixtures matched (`<iScan` substring found in IFDs 0 and 2 on both Ventana-1.bif and OS-1.bif), 0 false positives across 15 non-BIF fixtures (5 SVS, 3 NDPI, 1 generic TIFF, 2 OME-TIFF, 4 Philips TIFF). All BIF fixtures are BigTIFF as expected. Confirms substring `<iScan` is sufficient and specific for detection — aligns with openslide's approach (line 328 of `src/openslide-vendor-ventana.c` checks `strstr(xml, INITIAL_XML_ISCAN)`). No detection-rule refinement needed; ready for format reader implementation.

#### Task 2 — ScannerModel prefix gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Outcome:** Both fixtures probe as expected per spec §4 and §5.2. Ventana-1.bif reports `ScannerModel="VENTANA DP 200"` (matches prefix `"VENTANA DP"`) → routes to spec-compliant path. OS-1.bif has no ScannerModel attribute in the XMP (`<iScan>` element; attribute missing) → routes to legacy-iScan path. The `strings.HasPrefix(scannerModel, "VENTANA DP")` classification rule is confirmed as sufficient and specific to distinguish Ventana (spec-compliant) from legacy iScan (non-Ventana) scanners. Aligns with openslide's branching logic and the v0.7 design's §4 scope. No spec revision needed; gate passes.

#### Task 3 — IFD-classification-by-description gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Outcome:** All IFD ImageDescription values across both BIF fixtures match the spec §5.3 discriminator rule exactly. No unexpected values; no case/whitespace variants requiring special handling.

  **Per-fixture IFD inventory:**

  | Fixture | IFD | ImageDescription | Role | Notes |
  |---------|-----|------------------|------|-------|
  | Ventana-1.bif | 0 | `'Label_Image'` | associated, kind="overview" | spec-compliant (DP 200) |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 1 | `'Probability_Image'` | associated, kind="probability" | spec-compliant |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 2–9 | `level=N mag=M quality=95` | pyramid levels 0–7 | 8 levels total |
  | OS-1.bif | 0 | `'Label Image'` | associated, kind="overview" | legacy (space separator) |
  | OS-1.bif | 1 | `'Thumbnail'` | associated, kind="thumbnail" | legacy variant |
  | OS-1.bif | 2–11 | `level=N mag=M quality=90` | pyramid levels 0–9 | 10 levels total (OS-1 has deeper pyramid) |

  **Discriminator coverage:** The five discriminator patterns from spec §5.3 (`Label_Image`, `Label Image`, `Probability_Image`, `Thumbnail`, `level=N mag=M quality=Q`) account for 100% of observed IFDs. Ventana-1.bif spans the spec-compliant path (DP 200 with probability map); OS-1.bif exercises the legacy-iScan path (label as space-delimited, no probability, thumbnail instead). Both confirm that **classification by ImageDescription content is sufficient** — no need to index into IFD order, validating spec §5.3's core recommendation despite OS-1's non-standard IFD layout (IFD 0 = label, IFD 1 = thumbnail, IFD 2+ = pyramid, unlike the whitepaper's IFD 0/1/2/3+ layout).

#### Task 4 — Empty-tile gate (offset-zero / bytecount-zero marker)

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Outcome:** Both fixtures carry zero empty tiles across all pyramid levels. Whitepaper spec (§3, "AOI Positions") confirms empty-tile encoding: `TileOffsets[i] == 0` AND `TileByteCounts[i] == 0` for unscanned tiles. Probe verified: zero mismatches (no partial-empty case where one field is 0 and the other is non-zero).

  **Per-fixture, per-IFD tile inventory:**

  | Fixture | IFD | Role | Total tiles | Empty tiles | Notes |
  |---------|-----|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
  | Ventana-1.bif | 2 | L0 | 504 | 0 | main pyramid base |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 3 | L1 | 132 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 4 | L2 | 36 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 5 | L3 | 9 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 6 | L4 | 4 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 7 | L5 | 1 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 8 | L6 | 1 | 0 | |
  | Ventana-1.bif | 9 | L7 | 1 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 0 | overview | 1 | 0 | associated image |
  | OS-1.bif | 1 | thumbnail | 1 | 0 | associated image |
  | OS-1.bif | 2 | L0 | 8700 | 0 | main pyramid base |
  | OS-1.bif | 3 | L1 | 2204 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 4 | L2 | 551 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 5 | L3 | 150 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 6 | L4 | 40 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 7 | L5 | 12 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 8 | L6 | 4 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 9 | L7 | 1 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 10 | L8 | 1 | 0 | |
  | OS-1.bif | 11 | L9 | 1 | 0 | |

  **Implication for Task 14:** Both fixtures are single-AOI scans with complete tile coverage — no real empty tiles to validate the blank-fill path. Task 14 (empty-tile synthesis testing) must include a synthetic BIF-XMP test fixture with explicit empty tiles. The spec's encoding is confirmed as sufficient discriminator; the implementation path (fill with `ScanWhitePoint`-coloured JPEG) has no in-fixture validation opportunity.

#### Task 5 — ScanWhitePoint extraction gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Outcome:** Both fixtures probe successfully for the `ScanWhitePoint` XMP attribute. Ventana-1.bif carries `ScanWhitePoint="235"` (spec-compliant iScan, DP 200 scanner); OS-1.bif returns missing (legacy iScan, no ScannerModel attribute). Matches the design assumption exactly. When `ScanWhitePoint` is absent, the blank-tile filler (Task 9, invoked by Task 14) defaults to RGB 255 (true white). This aligns with typical TIFF and openslide conventions for unspecified fill colour. Forward reference: Tasks 9 (blank-tile generator) and 14 (empty-tile path) will read this value to fill empty tiles; the precise extraction and JPEG-encoding details are specified when those tasks execute.

### v0.6 gates

#### Task 5 — tifffile splice-replication harness

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** simpler than spec assumed. **OME files don't carry
  shared JPEGTables** — every page in our fixtures has
  `jpegtables=None`, every tile / strip's raw bytes start with
  SOI+JFIF (self-contained). For tiled levels, opentile-py's
  `get_tile()` output is **byte-identical to tifffile's raw bytes**
  with no splicing involved (verified on Leica-1 L0 (0,0):
  sha `668b391411f5ec95`, 17359 bytes, both paths).

- **Refined parity strategy** (revises spec §5):

  1. **Tiled levels of every Image**: tifffile reads raw tile bytes
     via `dataoffsets[idx]` / `databytecounts[idx]`; compare directly
     to our `Tile(x, y)` output. No Python-side splice needed. Works
     for all images including those opentile-py drops.

  2. **OneFrame levels of opentile-py-exposed images**
     (Leica-1 main; Leica-2 series 4): opentile-py's `get_tile()`
     gives the cropped output bytes. Compare directly to our output.

  3. **OneFrame levels of dropped images** (Leica-2 series 1-3): no
     byte-stable Python reference (opentile-py never sees them, and
     tifffile only gives raw single-strip bytes, not the cropped
     output). Coverage strategy:
     - Transitive correctness: our OneFrame implementation is the
       shared `internal/oneframe/` package validated by NDPI parity
       on every NDPI fixture.
     - Integration fixture SHAs: each OneFrame tile in those images
       gets a committed SHA snapshot; regressions are caught by
       `TestSlideParity`.

- **Consequence:** the new tifffile oracle (Task 19) is simpler than
  the spec's draft — no Python-side splice logic, just raw-byte read.
  ~30 LOC of Python rather than ~80.

#### Task 4 — OME-XML schema audit

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** clean. Both fixtures use the OME 2016-06 schema
  (namespace `http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06`).
  Per-fixture Image inventory:

  | Fixture | Images | Names observed | PhysicalSize unit | Type |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Leica-1.ome.tiff | 2 | `'macro'`, `''` (1) | µm on every Pixels | uint8 |
  | Leica-2.ome.tiff | 5 | `'macro'`, `''` × 4 | µm on every Pixels | uint8 |

  All Pixels elements carry PhysicalSizeX / PhysicalSizeY +
  PhysicalSizeXUnit / PhysicalSizeYUnit + SizeX / SizeY + Type
  attributes. No fixture is missing any. Empty Name attributes mean
  "main pyramid" per upstream's `_is_*_series` predicates (none of
  label / macro / thumbnail).

- **Consequence:** Task 12 (metadata parser) handles a single
  namespace URI (2016-06) for our fixtures. The parser should still
  use namespace wildcards (`xml:",any"` semantics) to be robust
  across OME schema versions — slides converted by older tooling
  may use earlier namespaces. All extracted fields (PhysicalSize,
  Size) can rely on µm units; reject other units as
  `ErrUnsupportedFormat` rather than half-implementing
  unit conversions. Type=uint8 is the only supported value (matches
  spec §8 out-of-scope).

#### Task 3 — OneFrame factor-or-copy decision

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** **factor**. Reading `formats/ndpi/oneframe.go` end-to-end:
  the body is already format-agnostic — single-strip JPEG read via
  generic `tiff.TagStripOffsets` / `tiff.TagStripByteCounts`, SOF
  parse and rewrite via `internal/jpeg`, MCU-aligned crop via
  `internal/jpegturbo`. No NDPI-specific tags (no McuStarts, no NDPI
  metadata refs). The only NDPI-shaped bits are the package name and
  one comment string.
- **Cross-check:** OME OneFrame levels also use single-strip
  JPEG-compressed pages whose strip bytes start with SOI+JFIF
  (self-contained — `jpegtables=None` on every OME fixture page).
  No JPEGTables splice required. Behaviour matches what
  `formats/ndpi/oneframe.go` already does.
- **Consequence:** Task 10 factors the body into `internal/oneframe/`.
  NDPI and OME both import it. Format-specific bits (MPP, pyramid
  index, level index) are set by the format package after
  construction. The factored package is a direct enabler for v0.7
  (BIF) which likely needs the same machinery.

#### Task 2 — SubIFD parsing audit

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** clean. SubIFDs (TIFF tag 330) are present on every
  OME pyramid base page and reachable via tifffile's `series.levels`
  API. Per-fixture inventory:

  | Fixture | Main series | SubIFDs / page | Total levels (top + sub) | Tiled / OneFrame split |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Leica-1.ome.tiff | 1 (page 1 base) | 4 | 5 | L0/L1 tiled, L2/L3/L4 OneFrame |
  | Leica-2.ome.tiff | 4 (pages 1-4 bases) | 5 each | 6 each = 24 main pyramid levels | L0/L1 tiled, L2-L5 OneFrame |
  | (both) macro page | macro = page 0 | 2 | 3 (L0 used as AssociatedImage; L1/L2 ignored) | All OneFrame |

  Python opentile reports `5 levels` for Leica-1 main and `6 levels`
  for Leica-2's exposed main series — matching tifffile's `series.levels`
  one-for-one. Compression on every page is JPEG (7) on both fixtures.

- **Consequences:**
  1. `internal/tiff.Page.SubIFDOffsets()` (Task 6) and
     `tiff.File.PageAtOffset()` (Task 7) are required.
  2. **OneFrame levels are dominant** (3-4 of 5-6 levels per main
     pyramid). Skipping them in v0.6 would parity-skip the majority
     of pyramid output — Task 15 (OneFrame support) is mandatory,
     not optional.
  3. The macro's own pyramid (its 2 SubIFDs) is NOT exposed in our
     port; we use only macro L0 as the AssociatedImage, matching
     upstream.

#### Task 1 — `is_ome` detection gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** clean. Tifffile's detection rule
  (`page index == 0 AND description[-10:].strip().endswith('OME>')`,
  `tifffile.py:10125-10129`) matches both Leica OME fixtures and
  produces zero false-positives across the other 15 fixtures (5 SVS,
  3 NDPI, 4 Philips, 2 Ventana .bif, 1 generic TIFF). Description
  tails: `'</StructuredAnnotations></OME>'` on both Leica fixtures;
  every non-OME fixture's tail is unrelated. The rule is simpler
  than v0.5's spec draft assumed (which proposed a 3-clause check
  on `<?xml`, `<OME ` substring, and the OME namespace URL).
- **Consequence:** the v0.6 OME factory's `Supports()` predicate
  ports the rule verbatim — `strings.HasSuffix(strings.TrimSpace(desc[len-10:]), "OME>")`
  with bounds checks for short descriptions. No namespace-string
  matching needed.

### v0.5 gates

#### Task 1 — `is_philips` detection gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** clean. Tifffile's detection rule (`software[:10] == 'Philips DP'` AND `description[-16:].strip().endswith('</DataObject>')`) matches all 4 of our local Philips fixtures and produces zero false-positives across the other 13 fixtures (5 SVS, 3 NDPI, 2 OME, 2 Ventana .bif, 1 generic TIFF). Software values: `'Philips DP v1.0'` on every fixture; description tails: `'...</Attribute>\n</DataObject>'`. Non-Philips comparators that confirm the rule's specificity:
  - OME TIFF: `software='OME Bio-Formats 6.0.0-rc1'`, description tail `'</OME>'` — fails both clauses.
  - SVS: `software=None` — fails the prefix clause.
  - NDPI: `software='NDP.scan'` etc. — fails the prefix clause.
  - Ventana .bif: `software=None` or `'ScanOutputManager 1.1.0.15854'` — fails the prefix clause.
- **Consequence:** the v0.5 Philips factory's `Supports()` predicate ports the rule verbatim. No additional disambiguation needed.

#### Task 2 — `FillFrame` determinism gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** byte-deterministic. 5 passes through `Jpeg.fill_frame(src, 1.0)` in Python opentile (which wraps libjpeg-turbo's `tjTransform` with a CUSTOMFILTER that zeros all DCT coefficients, then sets the luma DC at the first block of each MCU) produced identical output bytes for the same source tile (SHA `05c3789cc691d9a207659e250b3fc9c799eca7c5019c4b084a441c4dca9da243`, 2,364 bytes; source: CMU-1-Small-Region.svs L0 tile (0,0), 3,985 bytes).
- **Consequence:** v0.5 sparse-tile blank-tile output (`internal/jpegturbo.FillFrame`) must byte-match Python opentile. Tasks 5 / 10 enforce byte-equality; the alternative pixel-equivalent fallback is not needed.

#### Task 3 — DICOM XML schema audit

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** the 11 attributes in upstream's TAGS list are all extractable from our 4 fixtures, but **two of them are missing on 3 of 4 fixtures** and three have multi-value formats. Concretely:
  - **Always present (4/4):** `DICOM_PIXEL_SPACING` (per-level series, count varies 9-11), `DICOM_BITS_ALLOCATED` (8), `DICOM_BITS_STORED` (8), `DICOM_HIGH_BIT` (7), `DICOM_LOSSY_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_METHOD`, `DICOM_LOSSY_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_RATIO`, `DICOM_MANUFACTURER`, `DICOM_PIXEL_REPRESENTATION` (0), `DICOM_SOFTWARE_VERSIONS`.
  - **Sometimes missing (1/4):** `DICOM_ACQUISITION_DATETIME` (only in Philips-4: `'20160718122300.000000'`), `DICOM_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER` (only in Philips-4: `'FMT0107'`). Parser must return zero/empty for these on the other 3 fixtures.
  - **Multi-value strings** (space-separated, quoted): `DICOM_SOFTWARE_VERSIONS` (e.g. `'"1.6.6186" "20150402_R48" "4.0.3"'` on Philips-4), `DICOM_LOSSY_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_METHOD` (e.g. `'"PHILIPS_DP_1_0" "PHILIPS_TIFF_1_0"'`), `DICOM_LOSSY_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_RATIO`. Parser strips quotes and splits on whitespace.
  - **Scanner manufacturer is not always "Philips":** Philips-1 + Philips-3 say `Hamamatsu`, Philips-2 says `3D Histech`, Philips-4 says `PHILIPS`. The format is open — non-Philips scanners can emit Philips TIFF. Surfacing the actual manufacturer string verbatim is correct (no normalisation).
  - **`DICOM_PIXEL_SPACING` example value:** `'"0.000226891" "0.000226907"'` — quoted, space-separated `(W, H)` in metres-per-pixel. Floats with quotes around each. Parser strips quotes and splits.
  - **`DICOM_ACQUISITION_DATETIME` format:** `'20160718122300.000000'` — Go layout: `"20060102150405.000000"`. Microseconds are always zero in our one example.
- **Consequence:** Task 11 (PhilipsTiffMetadata XML parser) handles missing values via Optional / pointer-to-T patterns, splits on whitespace + strips `"` for the multi-value string fields, parses dates with the documented Go layout. No additional disambiguation needed beyond what upstream's parser already encodes.

### v0.4 gates

### Task 1 — JP2K determinism gate

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** byte-deterministic. Two passes through
  `imagecodecs.jpeg2k_encode` with the upstream Python opentile
  options (level=80, codecformat=J2K, colorspace=SRGB, mct=True,
  reversible=False, bitspersample=8) on the JP2K-33003-1.svs L0
  tile (0,0) produced identical bytes:
  ```
  pass1 sha256=5862056ca6dcbd079403c1f5debd36ce104afe9bbb2fd56ffc5fec2ca7f82080 len=58366
  pass2 sha256=5862056ca6dcbd079403c1f5debd36ce104afe9bbb2fd56ffc5fec2ca7f82080 len=58366
  identical=True
  pixel_equal=True
  ```
- **Consequence:** v0.4 R4 (SVS corrupt-edge reconstruct) targets
  **byte-parity** with Python opentile. Tasks 12 / 16 enforce
  byte-equality assertions; the alternative pixel-equivalent fallback
  is not needed.

### Task 3 — L12 reproduction shape

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** **Case D — neither libjpeg-turbo bug nor cgo wrapper bug. The divergence is in our control flow above the wrapper.** The plan offered Cases A/B/C; the actual finding is sharper.

  Determinism check (5 passes each, OS-2.ndpi L5 tile (3,0)):
  - Go side: byte-deterministic (sha `16996cac…6fbc`, 76,418 bytes, 5/5 identical)
  - Python side: byte-deterministic (sha `a1173319…8a24`, 76,307 bytes, 5/5 identical)
  - Each side individually deterministic; the divergence is purely between languages.

  Pixel comparison of the two outputs (after libjpeg decode):
  - Image content (cols 0-895, the in-image region): byte-equal pixel-for-pixel ✓
  - OOB strip (cols 896-1023, image x=3968-4095 past the L5 image's x=3968 right edge):
    - Go: RGB = (128, 128, 128) — mid-gray
    - Python: RGB = (255, 255, 255) — white

  Our `LuminanceToDCCoefficient(luminance=1.0)` returns the correct DC=170 (verified locally on the same OS-2 L5 JPEGHeader). So the cached `dcBackground` is right; we just don't use it on this tile because the dispatch never reaches `CropWithBackgroundLuminanceOpts`.

  Root cause:
  - **Python** (`turbojpeg.py:608-694` `crop_multiple`, gated by `__need_fill_background` at `turbojpeg.py:839-863`) decides geometry-first: route through CUSTOMFILTER iff `crop_region.x + crop_region.w > image_size[0]` (or similar in y) AND luminance ≠ 0.5. Doesn't try plain `Crop` first.
  - **Go** (`formats/ndpi/striped.go::Tile` post-acc2282) tries plain `Crop` first, falls through to `CropWithBackgroundLuminanceOpts` only if `Crop` errors. For OS-2 L5 tile (3,0) and similar edge tiles, `Crop` SUCCEEDS (libjpeg-turbo accepts the MCU-aligned geometry even though it extends past the image). We never call `CropWithBackground`. Plain `Crop`'s default OOB fill is mid-gray (DC=0), not the white-fill DC the cached `dcBackground` would have planted.

  This is the same divergence the v0.3 T30 task uncovered — and reverted (`acc2282`). The revert was the wrong call: T30's geometry-first inversion was the correct fix; the v0.3 fixtures that "broke" were encoding the buggy mid-gray output. Deferred entry L12 currently misframes this as "tjTransform CUSTOMFILTER non-determinism," which is wrong on every count.

- **Consequence:** L12 is a control-flow fix, not a libjpeg-turbo investigation. Two changes needed in v0.4 Task 9:
  1. Replace `frameSize`-based `extendsBeyond` with the **image-size-based** geometry check that matches Python's `__need_fill_background`. Specifically:
     `extendsBeyond := tileXOrigin+l.tileSize.W > l.size.W || tileYOrigin+l.tileSize.H > l.size.H`
     where `tileXOrigin = x * l.tileSize.W` (position in the image, not the assembled frame).
  2. Always route through `CropWithBackgroundLuminanceOpts` when `extendsBeyond` is true, regardless of whether `Crop` would succeed.
  3. Regenerate the OS-2 / Hamamatsu-1 NDPI fixtures with the corrected output (the v0.3 fixtures currently encode the wrong mid-gray fill on edge tiles). Confirm new fixtures byte-match Python via the parity oracle.

  No C-only repro needed; no upstream-bug ticket; no L12 → Permanent demotion.

  **Status (2026-04-26): fixed.** Task 9 landed the dispatch change and regen'd CMU-1 / OS-2 / Hamamatsu-1 NDPI fixtures. Parity oracle removes the L12 carve-out in the same commit; every NDPI tile is now byte-equal to Python opentile.

### Task 2 — NDPI Map fixture audit

- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Outcome:** Map pages present on two of three local NDPI fixtures.
  ```
  CMU-1.ndpi          : no Map page (5 pages, max mag = 20.0, min = -1.0)
  OS-2.ndpi           : page 11 (198x580)  mag=-2.0  <-- MAP
  Hamamatsu-1.ndpi    : page  7 (205x600)  mag=-2.0  <-- MAP
  ```
  Upstream confirmation, two layers:
  - **tifffile** (`_series_ndpi`, tifffile.py:5049-5072) DOES classify
    Map pages — `s.name = 'Map'` for `mag == -2.0`. The data is
    structurally exposed at the tifffile layer; a consumer reaches
    them via `TiffFile(path).series[i]` then `pages[0].asarray()`.
  - **Python opentile** (`NdpiTiler` in `ndpi_tiler.py:88-102`) does
    NOT expose Map pages. `_is_label_series` and `_is_thumbnail_series`
    both return False; only `_is_overview_series` (matching "Macro")
    surfaces anything. There's no `_is_map_series` predicate and no
    `tiler.maps` property.
  Surfacing Map pages on the Go side is therefore filling an
  opentile-level scope decision, not inventing a new category — the
  precedent exists at the tifffile layer. Parallels the v0.2 NDPI
  label synthesis (L14).
  Both Map pages on our fixtures are 8-bit grayscale (uint8, 2D
  shape — no third dim). Task 6's `mapPage` implementation should
  byte-passthrough the strip (same pattern as `KindLabel` for SVS
  LZW labels: bytes the source carried, with whatever Compression
  the page advertises). Downstream consumers decoding the Map page
  need to expect a single-channel image, not RGB.
- **Consequence:** L6 / R13 stays in v0.4 scope. Tasks 6-8 proceed
  using OS-2 + Hamamatsu-1 fixtures.

## 10. Triage process

Once the branch lands on a remote, every numbered item above should become a tracked issue (GitHub, Linear, etc.) — scope items → roadmap epics, limitations → user-facing docs, reviewer suggestions → individual backlog tickets. Delete entries from this file as they get filed. The goal is for this file to eventually shrink to zero as polish milestones retire each item.
