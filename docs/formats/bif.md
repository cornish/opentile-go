# Ventana BIF (Roche)

Roche's WSI format for the VENTANA DP family of scanners (DP 200, DP 600, …) and predecessor iScan scanners (Coreo, HT). File extension `.bif`. The format is publicly specified by Roche (the [BIF whitepaper](https://www.roche.com/) v1.0, 2020) but only the DP 200 generation is documented in detail; legacy iScan slides require openslide-style permissive interpretation.

**v0.7 is the first opentile-go format beyond upstream Python opentile's coverage.** Upstream doesn't read BIF; openslide does (LGPL 2.1) but rejects spec-compliant DP 200 BIFs and may misinterpret modern BIFs generally — see "Parity" below.

## Format basics

- **TIFF dialect**: BigTIFF only (the spec mandates it; both real fixtures match).
- **Detection**: BigTIFF with at least one IFD whose XMP packet (TIFF tag 700) contains the substring `<iScan`. Mirrors openslide's `INITIAL_XML_ISCAN` rule. Verified via the T1 detection gate against 17 sample fixtures: 2 BIF hits, 0 false positives across SVS / NDPI / Philips / OME / generic-TIFF.
- **Generation classification**: post-detection, the IFD-0 `<iScan>/@ScannerModel` attribute routes the slide. `strings.HasPrefix(scannerModel, "VENTANA DP")` → spec-compliant path (DP 200, DP 600, future DP); everything else → legacy-iScan path (missing attribute, iScan Coreo, iScan HT).
- **Pyramid layout**: top-level IFDs sorted by parsed `level=N` from each IFD's ImageDescription. Spec describes IFD 0 = label, IFD 1 = probability, IFD 2 = scan, IFD 3+ = pyramid; **OS-1 (legacy) violates this**: IFD 0 = label, IFD 1 = thumbnail, IFD 2..11 = pyramid (no probability). v0.7 classifies by ImageDescription content, not by IFD index.
- **Compression**: JPEG (tag 7) on every pyramid IFD. Associated images: NONE (Ventana-1 IFD 0 RGB raw strips), LZW (Ventana-1 IFD 1 grayscale probability strips), or JPEG (OS-1 IFD 0/1 single-tile).
- **Storage order**: TileOffsets is in physical-stage **serpentine** order, not image-space row-major. Stage rows count up from the bottom; even rows go left-to-right, odd rows right-to-left. The remap is in `formats/bif/serpentine.go::imageToSerpentine`. Confirmed against tifffile (`tests/oracle/tifffile_test.go::TestTifffileParityBIF` passes byte-equality on Ventana-1).
- **Tile overlap**: spec-compliant DP 200 slides record per-tile-pair overlap in the `<EncodeInfo>/<SlideStitchInfo>/<ImageInfo>/<TileJointInfo>` XMP elements. v0.7 collapses these to a single weighted-average `image.Point` per level, exposed via the new `Level.TileOverlap()` interface method. Pyramid IFDs 1+ are non-overlapping per spec.

## Fixture inventory

| File | Bytes | Generation | ScannerModel | openslide reads? | JPEGTables (tag 347) |
|---|---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| `Ventana-1.bif` | 227 MB | DP 200 (BuildVersion 1.1.0.15854, 2019) | `"VENTANA DP 200"` | ❌ rejects (`Direction="LEFT"`) | absent (per-tile embedded) |
| `OS-1.bif` | 3.6 GB | iScan Coreo (BuildVersion 3.3.1.1, 2011) | (missing) | ✅ reads | present (shared) |

The two fixtures are deliberately complementary — one tests the spec-compliant path that openslide rejects; the other tests the legacy path openslide accepts. Together they span both sides of the JPEGTables decision (per-tile embedded vs. shared) and exercise the ScanWhitePoint default-fallback.

## What's supported

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BigTIFF detection + classification | ✅ | T1 / T2 / T3 gates pin the discriminator behaviour (see deferred.md §9 v0.7 gates) |
| Tiled pyramid levels | ✅ | Both raw-passthrough (Ventana-1: no JPEGTables) and `jpeg.InsertTables`-spliced output (OS-1: shared tables) |
| Serpentine → image-space remap | ✅ | `imageToSerpentine` + inverse, round-trip-tested |
| Empty tiles (TileOffsets[i]=0 AND TileByteCounts[i]=0) | ✅ | Filled with `ScanWhitePoint`-coloured JPEG via `formats/bif/blanktile.go` (T9). Both real fixtures have zero empty tiles — synthetic-only fixture coverage on this path |
| Probability map exposure (spec-compliant only) | ✅ | New `AssociatedImage.Kind() == "probability"` (LZW grayscale; multi-strip raw passthrough) |
| Thumbnail exposure (legacy only) | ✅ | `AssociatedImage.Kind() == "thumbnail"` (single-tile JPEG) |
| Label / overview exposure (every fixture) | ✅ | `AssociatedImage.Kind() == "overview"`. Ventana-1: multi-strip uncompressed RGB. OS-1: single-tile JPEG |
| ICC profile passthrough | ✅ | `Tiler.ICCProfile()` returns level-0 IFD's tag 34675 (Ventana-1 has 1.8 MB; OS-1 has tag-with-zero-bytes → returns nil) |
| Generation-aware metadata via `bif.MetadataOf` | ✅ | Generation, ScanRes, ScanWhitePoint+Present, ZLayers, AOIs, AOIOrigins, EncodeInfoVer |
| EncodeInfo Ver < 2 rejection | ✅ | spec mandates Ver≥2; `bifxml.ParseEncodeInfo` enforces; `Open` propagates the error |
| Defensive Direction value tolerance | ✅ | All 4 spec values + any unknown string passes through verbatim into `bifxml.TileJoint.Direction` (no enum validation, unlike openslide) |

## What's not supported

| Capability | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Volumetric Z-stacks | ❌ — defer to v0.8+ | v0.7 surfaces only the nominal focus plane (first M×N tiles per IFD per spec §"Whole slide imaging process"). `IMAGE_DEPTH` (tag 32997) is read into metadata but not interpreted. Tracked as L21 |
| openslide pixel-equivalence | ⚠️ — infrastructure-only in v0.7 | The runner / session / protocol are in `tests/oracle/openslide_*` but the assertion is gated. Resolution depends on whether opentile-go's padded-grid view or openslide's AOI-hull view is the right one to expose. Tracked as L19 |
| DP 600 verification | ⚠️ — schedule-driven | The `HasPrefix("VENTANA DP")` rule lands DP 600 on the spec-compliant path; behavioural variance from DP 200 is unverified without a fixture. Tracked as L20 |
| AOI-cropped Tile variant | ❌ — not designed yet | opentile-go's `Tile(col, row)` references the padded TIFF grid; an AOI-cropped variant would expose openslide's view. v0.8 work item |
| Multi-tile associated images | ❌ — error | Both real fixtures have single-tile or multi-strip associated pages; multi-tile seems unused in practice |

## Parity

Three layered oracles cover v0.7 BIF correctness:

1. **tifffile byte-equality** (`tests/oracle/tifffile_test.go::TestTifffileParityBIF`) — Ventana-1 only. Tests opentile-go's `Tile(col, row)` raw-passthrough output against tifffile's `page.dataoffsets[serpentine_idx]` raw bytes. Confirms (a) serpentine algebra correctness, (b) level=N → page sorting, (c) TileOffsets indexing. OS-1 excluded because shared JPEGTables modify the bytes.

2. **Sampled-tile SHA256 fixtures** (`tests/integration_test.go::TestSlideParity`) — both fixtures. Records corner / centre / edge probe SHA256 hashes in `tests/fixtures/Ventana-1.bif.json` and `OS-1.bif.json`; regenerate via `OPENTILE_TESTDIR=$PWD/sample_files go test ./tests -tags generate -run TestGenerateFixtures -generate -v`. Catches regressions in our own output across both fixture types.

3. **Geometry sanity tests** (`tests/parity/bif_geometry_test.go::TestBIFGeometry`) — both fixtures, no build tag, runs in `make test`. Pins per-level Size / TileSize / Grid / TileOverlap, JPEG markers, ICC presence, AOI origin alignment, EncodeInfo Ver, Generation, ScanRes.

**openslide pixel-equivalence is NOT a v0.7 correctness bar.** The original v0.7 design (spec §7) intended it as the primary oracle; mid-implementation we found that (a) openslide rejects DP 200 BIFs entirely, and (b) for OS-1 it uses an AOI-hull coordinate system that differs from opentile-go's padded TIFF grid. Anecdotal community note: openslide is also believed to misread modern BIF generally. The runner / session / test scaffold ship in v0.7 (T20) for v0.8 follow-up; the test currently `t.Skip`s with a clear gap explanation.

## Deviations from upstream Python opentile

Upstream Python opentile doesn't read BIF, so every v0.7 behaviour is technically a deviation. The interesting ones — captured in [`docs/deferred.md` §1a](../deferred.md#1a-deviations-from-upstream-python-opentile) — are:

| Deviation | Since | Opt-out | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Probability map exposure as `kind="probability"` | v0.7 | iterate `Associated()` and skip the kind | Slide author embedded it; throwing it away is value loss. Joins the existing kind taxonomy (overview / macro / thumbnail / label / map / probability) |
| `Level.TileOverlap() image.Point` interface evolution | v0.7 | non-BIF formats return `image.Point{}` (zero) — no caller change needed | Tile() returns raw compressed bytes (preserving byte-passthrough hot path); consumer needs the overlap value to position tiles correctly |
| Non-strict `ScannerModel` acceptance | v0.7 | not opt-out-able | Spec mandates `ScannerModel == "VENTANA DP 200"` rejection-otherwise; we accept any iScan-tagged BigTIFF and route via `HasPrefix("VENTANA DP")` so legacy iScan slides aren't worse-than-openslide |

## Known issues + history

- **Detection regex** is the literal substring `<iScan` (with opening angle bracket) to discriminate against arbitrary text containing the word "iScan" outside an XML element context.
- **OS-1 has no `<EncodeInfo>/<FrameInfo>/<Frame>` elements** at all — predates that XMP feature. The serpentine algorithm works without Frame data; if a future fixture surfaces meaningful Frame disagreements, we'd add per-pair lookup.
- **Both fixtures carry NON-ZERO TileOverlap on level 0** (Ventana-1 L0=(2,0); OS-1 L0=(18,26)) — contrary to the v0.7 design spec §10's initial "fixture-untested overlap path" claim. The notes file's "all zero" claim was based on a 1500-char XMP truncation; the full XMP carries a sparse mix of zero and non-zero `<TileJointInfo>` entries.
- **Two correctness bugs caught only by writing the integration test (T19)**: (a) `loadEncodeInfo` swallowed `bifxml.ParseEncodeInfo`'s Ver<2 error, defeating the spec-mandated rejection gate; (b) `bif.MetadataOf` didn't unwrap the file-closer Tiler returned by `opentile.OpenFile`, so it always returned `(nil, false)` on real callers. Both fixed in `49849a4`.
