# opentile-go

Direct Go port of [imi-bigpicture/opentile](https://github.com/imi-bigpicture/opentile) (Apache 2.0, Sectra AB) with one cgo dependency (libjpeg-turbo, narrowly scoped to `internal/jpegturbo/`). Reads tiles from WSI (whole-slide imaging) TIFF files used in digital pathology.

## Current milestone — v0.9 (shipped)

- **Scope:** Sole-focus performance milestone implementing the §A items from `docs/opentile-go-svs-perf.md`. All five shipped: A.1 mmap-backed `OpenFile` (default); A.2 `Level.TileInto(x, y, dst)` + `Level.TileMaxSize()`; A.3 in-place JPEG splice template (internal `BuildSplicePrefix` + `InsertPrefixInPlace`); A.4 `Tiler.WarmLevel(i int) error`; A.5 concurrency-contract docs.
- **Headline perf:** Cervix IFE pool TileInto: 22µs → 152 ns (145×). SVS pool TileInto: 1583 → 99.7 ns (16×, 0 allocs). Philips: 6473 → 425 ns (15×, 0 allocs). Every TIFF format and IFE at 0 allocs/op on the pool path. NDPI unchanged (CPU-bound libjpeg-turbo transcoding).
- **API additions:** `WithBacking(BackingMmap | BackingPread)` Option (defaults mmap); `ErrMmapUnavailable` sentinel; `Level.TileInto`, `Level.TileMaxSize`, `Tiler.WarmLevel` interface methods (additive). Single new dep: `golang.org/x/exp/mmap` (Go-team subrepo, cross-platform Linux + macOS + Windows).
- **Behavior change:** `OpenFile(path)` mmap-backs by default. Auto-fallback to pread on mmap failure (FUSE / unusual fs); explicit `WithBacking(BackingPread)` opt-out. SIGBUS on file truncation under mmap is the documented failure mode; loud crash beats silent corruption.
- **Active limitations:** Same as post-v0.8 (L4, L5, L14 Permanent; L19, L20 v0.7 deferred; L23, L24, L25 v0.8 deferred). v0.9 retired no L items — sole-focus perf.
- **Deviations from upstream Python opentile** (canonical list at `docs/deferred.md §1a`): everything from v0.8 plus three v0.9 entries (default mmap, pool-friendly TileInto API, WarmLevel hook).
- **Correctness bar:** Pre-flight benchmark gate (`tests/parity/perf_baseline_test.go` under `-tags benchgate`) captured baseline-vs-after deltas across the full parity slate. Four committed snapshots (`tests/fixtures/v0.9-{baseline,after-mmap,after-tileinto,after-splice}.txt`) document the optimization journey. Existing byte-equality oracle (`make parity`) + new cross-backing parity test (`TestOpenFileBackingsByteIdentical`) gate correctness.
- **T7 lesson:** initial profile gate said "skip splice template" at 2.5% CPU. Owner review reversed via bytes/ns analysis (splice path was 6× worse throughput-per-byte). Recorded in `docs/deferred.md §10a`: don't gate solely on cumulative CPU%; check allocs + throughput too.
- **Deferred forward:** L19, L20, L23, L24, L25, R4/R6/R9, R15, R16, plus v0.9 follow-ons (`Level.TilePrefix()` accessor, zero-copy `TileBorrow`). Consolidated list at `docs/deferred.md §11` for post-v0.9 re-triage.
- **Design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-opentile-go-v09-perf-design.md`
- **Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-01-opentile-go-v09-perf.md`

- **Perf guide:** `docs/perf.md`
- **Work branch:** `feat/v0.9`

## Invariants

- **Public API stable from v0.3.** Adding new exported names is fine; renaming, moving, or removing is a breaking change that requires a major-version bump (or, until we have external users, an explicit owner sign-off).
- **Don't guess format behavior — read upstream.** This is a **direct port** of Python opentile (which delegates format details to tifffile). Whenever classification, layout, tag semantics, or edge-case handling is unclear: **read `imi-bigpicture/opentile` first, then `cgohlke/tifffile`**. Guessed behavior cost v0.2 five separate debugging cycles (NDPI IFD layout, NDPI metadata tag numbers, NDPI StripOffsets tag, NDPI striped vs. oneframe gate, APP14 byte values) — every one fixed by reading the actual upstream source. The v0.4 plan elevates this to a structural per-task `Step 0: Confirm upstream` action that the executor must run before any production-code edit. The rule: if you catch yourself reasoning from first principles about a WSI format quirk, stop and find the upstream code that handles it. Port directly, adapt for Go idioms, but preserve the logic.
- **No cutting corners; no active users yet.** Complete things we know are broken before moving on. When a bug is identified, the rule is: fix it, don't defer. Plan thoroughly for v0.3+ rather than race.
- **Architectural placement of ported logic:** format-specific quirks belong in the format package (`formats/ndpi/`, `formats/svs/`), not `internal/tiff`. `internal/tiff` stays a generic TIFF/BigTIFF/NDPI-IFD parser. Examples: NDPI page-series grouping, SVS ImageDescription quirks, Philips sparse-tile filling.
- **cgo is narrowly scoped.** `internal/jpegturbo/` is the only package linking libjpeg-turbo. Under `nocgo` build tag, format paths that need it return `ErrCGORequired`; the rest works.
- **Direct port under Apache 2.0** with attribution retained in `NOTICE`. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Sectra AB or the BigPicture project.
- **Parity with upstream is the correctness bar.** Upstream's pytest cases are ported to Go tests; a fixture-backed integration suite compares tile bytes against a committed snapshot. An opt-in `//go:build parity` harness that shells out to Python opentile is v0.2.
- **Lock-free hot path for metadata.** Parsed IFDs, per-tile offset/length arrays, and metadata are populated at `Open()` time and immutable thereafter. `Tile()` is safe to call concurrently from many goroutines — the shared-state caches in `formats/ndpi/striped.go` (per-frame assembly cache) and `formats/ndpi/oneframe.go` (extended-frame cache) use double-checked locking and `sync.Once` respectively and produce byte-deterministic results regardless of which goroutine populates them first.

## Conventions

- Module path: `github.com/cornish/opentile-go`
- Go 1.23+ (for `iter.Seq2`)
- `internal/tiff` and `internal/jpeg` are internal — both shaped for opentile's needs, not general-purpose libraries. `internal/jpegturbo` is the only cgo package in the module.
- Format subpackages (`formats/svs/`, `formats/ndpi/`, …) are public; `formats/all` is the umbrella registration package
- `io.ReaderAt` + `int64` size is the core input (stdlib `*os.File` satisfies concurrent-use semantics)
- Public tile methods: `Level.Tile(x, y int)` returns raw compressed bytes; `Level.TileReader(x, y)` streams via `io.SectionReader`; `Level.Tiles(ctx)` is serial row-major via `iter.Seq2`

## Commands

The Makefile bundles every gate. Prefer it over typing the env-var dance manually:

```sh
make test     # go test ./... -race -count=1
make cover    # ≥80% per package; OPENTILE_TESTDIR auto-set
make parity   # batched parity oracle vs Python opentile 0.20.0
make vet      # go vet ./...
make bench    # NDPI per-tile throughput regression gate
```

Direct invocations (when the Makefile-implicit env defaults aren't right):

```sh
# regenerate parity fixtures from real slides (walks svs/ and ndpi/)
OPENTILE_TESTDIR="$PWD/sample_files" \
  go test ./tests -tags generate -run TestGenerateFixtures -generate -v

# byte-parity vs Python opentile 0.20.0 with custom Python interpreter
OPENTILE_ORACLE_PYTHON=/private/tmp/opentile-py/bin/python \
OPENTILE_TESTDIR="$PWD/sample_files" \
  go test ./tests/oracle/... -tags parity -v
```

## Execution mode

Plan execution uses `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`: one fresh implementer subagent per plan task, followed by a spec-compliance review subagent and a code-quality review subagent. Tasks are batched 4–6 at a time; after each batch, execution halts for a controller checkpoint before the next batch begins.
